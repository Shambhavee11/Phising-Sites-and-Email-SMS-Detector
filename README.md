#Phishing Site Detection and Emails/SMS Spam Detector

3.1 Email/SMS Spam Classifier: Process Description
1. Data Cleaning

Data cleansing is an important step in getting the dataset ready for analysis. To increase data quality, this method identifies and corrects flaws or inconsistencies. For an email/SMS spam classifier, data cleaning might include removing duplicate entries, correcting incorrect labels, and handling missing values to ensure the dataset is accurate and reliable for further analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves analysing the main characteristics of the dataset, often using visual methods. EDA helps in understanding the distribution, patterns, and anomalies in the data. For the spam classifier, EDA might include visualizing the frequency of spam versus non-spam messages, examining the distribution of message lengths, and identifying common words or phrases in spam messages.
3. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing transforms raw data into a suitable format for model building. For an email/SMS spam classifier, the preprocessing steps typically include:
•	Lowercasing: Converting all text data to lowercase to ensure uniformity, as “Spam” and “spam” should be treated identically.
•	Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens. This step breaks down messages into their constituent words or phrases, making it easier to analyze their content.
•	Removing Special Characters: Eliminating special characters (e.g., punctuation, symbols) that do not contribute meaningful information for spam detection. This helps in reducing noise in the data.
•	Removing Stop Words and Punctuation: Stop words (common words like “and”, “the”, “is”) are removed because they add little value to the spam detection process. Removing punctuation further cleans the text.
•	Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form (e.g., “running” becomes “run”). This helps in standardizing words with similar meanings and improves the model’s ability to generalize.
4. Model Building
Once the data is cleaned and pre-processed, various machine learning algorithms can be employed to build the spam classifier. The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and precision. The typical algorithms used in the process may include:
•	Support Vector Machine (SVM)-
Support vector machines (SVMs) is used for the classification of both linear and nonlinear data.
•	Decision Tree-
A decision tree is a directed, acyclic graph with two sorts of nodes: internal nodes, which represent tests, and terminal nodes, which include class labels.

•	K-Nearest Neighbour-
These are distance-based comparisons, which apply equal weights to each attribute.

•	Rotation Forest (RoF)-
Rotation Forest (RoF) is an ensemble classifier whose training data is generated by randomly partitioning the feature set into K subgroups and Principal.
•	Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to each subset for any base classifier.
•	Random Forests (RF)-
Random Forests can be constructed in conjunction with random attribute selection using bagging. Random Forests use an ensemble approach to learning, which is a divide-and-conquer method for improving performance.

3.2 Phishing Site Detection
The code sets up a phishing detection web application using Flask. It imports necessary libraries for web scraping, data manipulation, and machine learning. Several functions are defined to extract features from URLs, including checks for IP address presence, special characters, URL length, URL depth, redirection, HTTPS in the domain, URL shortening services, prefix/suffix in the domain, DNS record availability, web traffic, domain age, domain expiration, iframe redirection, mouseover events, web forwarding, and existence in a popular websites list. The feature Extraction function consolidates these features, and a POST route in Flask processes the input URL, extracts features, and uses a pre-trained SVM model to predict if the URL is phishing, returning the prediction result. The app runs in debug mode for development and testing purposes.
